RUN yarn install

# I noticed that when the docker image is being built, node-sass
# randomly just does not complete installation without clear error messages
# and so when the image is started, webpack would not be able to compile
# because node-sass >= 4 is not installed
# after installing dependencies, removing and re-installing node-sass below
# fixed this issue.
RUN yarn remove node-sass

# same issue above occurs here
RUN yarn add node-sass

# same issue above occurs here
RUN yarn add react-tooltip
